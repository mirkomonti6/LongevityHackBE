Here's why: As a 58-year-old woman working indoors as a software engineer, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis and bone health issues, and vitamin D is absolutely essential for calcium absorption and bone density. Your low HRV (35ms vs optimal 50-70+) suggests your body is stressed, and vitamin D plays a huge role in immune function and reducing inflammation. Plus, fixing your vitamin D will give you more energy to tackle those activity goals later! The science is clear - optimal vitamin D levels can reduce mortality risk by up to 30% according to major studies.

Let's tackle that vitamin D deficiency head-on! \\ud83c\\udfaf Your level of 12 ng/mL is seriously low (we want it between 40-60) and this is SO important for your bone health concerns.

Let's tackle that stress from the foundation up - with SLEEP! \\ud83d\\ude34 Looking at your smartwatch data, your HRV of 28ms shows your body is in constant stress mode (we want 50-70+). Your current sleep pattern is likely throwing your stress hormones out of whack! Here's the plan: aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep with a consistent 10pm-6am schedule. Create a relaxing pre-bed routine - no screens after 9pm, cool/dark room, maybe some light stretching. The science is amazing - a study by Knutson et al. (2010) found that consistent 7-8 hour sleepers had significantly better metabolic health and stress resilience! Within just 4 weeks, you could see improved glucose control and reduced inflammation.

As a 32-year-old fitness instructor training 6 days/week, you're pushing hard but the inflammation markers and low HRV suggest you're not recovering adequately. Omega-3s are perfect because they directly target CRP reduction (20-30% improvement expected!) while also supporting cardiovascular health and recovery. The Mediterranean diet is great but takes more lifestyle change, sleep optimization would help but your main issue is exercise-induced inflammation, and vitamin D is already decent at 32.

You'll take 2-4g of EPA+DHA daily with meals (I'd start with 2g and see how you feel). This is way more targeted than changing your whole diet, and way more effective than just optimizing sleep.
